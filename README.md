Welcome, to this Dynamic Project Where We are going to discuss on the Topic Jupyter Notebooks. So, First of all what is Jupyter notebooks? 
Jupyter Notebooks are an open-source, interactive web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualisations and narrative text.The name "Jupyter" is derived from the three core programming languages it supports: Julia, Python, and R. However, Jupyter notebooks can also be used with other languages.
Here are some key features and concepts related to Jupyter notebooks:

* Notebook Interface: The Jupyter notebook interface is a web-based application that allows you to create and work with notebooks. It provides a cell-based structure where each cell can contain code, markdown text, or rich media.

* Cells: The basic building blocks of a Jupyter notebook are cells. There are two main types of cells:

* Code Cells: Used for writing and executing code snippets. You can run the code within a code cell to see the output.
* Markdown Cells: Used for writing formatted text, including headings, lists, and other Markdown-supported elements.
* Kernel: The kernel is the computational engine that executes the code contained in a notebook. When you run a code cell, the kernel processes the code and returns the results. You can restart the kernel to clear all variables and start fresh.

* Magic Commands: Jupyter notebooks support special commands called "magic commands" that provide additional functionality. Magic commands start with a % symbol. For example, %matplotlib inline is a magic command that allows you to display Matplotlib plots directly in the notebook.

* Rich Output: Jupyter notebooks can display rich output, including images, videos, HTML, and interactive widgets. This makes them suitable for data analysis, visualization, and exploration.

* File Format: Notebooks are usually saved with the extension .ipynb, which stands for "IPython Notebook." These files can be shared and opened in various environments that support Jupyter.

* Jupyter Ecosystem: Jupyter is not limited to the notebook interface; it has an ecosystem of tools and extensions. JupyterLab is an advanced interactive development environment that provides a more flexible interface, while nbconvert allows you to convert notebooks to different formats, such as HTML or PDF.

* Popular Libraries: Jupyter notebooks are widely used in data science and scientific computing. Popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow are commonly used within Jupyter environments.

To use Jupyter notebooks, WE need to have Python or another supported language installed on your system. We can install Jupyter itself using the Python package manager (pip) by running the command pip install jupyter.

Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive and exploratory environment, making them popular in fields such as data science, machine learning, research, and education.
Here is the introduction about Jupyter notebooks. Where we get to know about all basics components of Jupyter Notebooks.

* To install Jupyter, we typically use a package manager like pip (for Python). We can install Jupyter by running:
# pip install jupyter
After installation, We can start Jupyter by typing jupyter notebook in our terminal or command prompt.

Certainly! Jupyter notebooks support various programming languages, but the most common one is Python. Below is the code of Jupyter notebook both code cells and markdown cells-



# This is a code cell
# You can write and execute Python code in these cells

# Cell 1: Python code
print("Hello, World!")

# Cell 2: Python code with variable assignment
a = 5
b = 10
result = a + b
result

# Cell 3: Python code with visualization using Matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Function')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.show()
