Welcome, to this Dynamic Project Where We are going to discuss on the Topic Jupyter Notebooks. So, First of all what is Jupyter notebooks? 
Jupyter Notebooks are an open-source, interactive web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualisations and narrative text.The name "Jupyter" is derived from the three core programming languages it supports: Julia, Python, and R. However, Jupyter notebooks can also be used with other languages.
Here are some key features and concepts related to Jupyter notebooks:

* Notebook Interface: The Jupyter notebook interface is a web-based application that allows us to create and work with notebooks. It provides a cell-based structure where each cell can contain code, markdown text, or rich media.

* Cells: The basic building blocks of a Jupyter notebook are cells. There are two main types of cells:

* Code Cells: Used for writing and executing code snippets. You can run the code within a code cell to see the output.
* Markdown Cells: Used for writing formatted text, including headings, lists, and other Markdown-supported elements.
* Kernel: The kernel is the computational engine that executes the code contained in a notebook. When you run a code cell, the kernel processes the code and returns the results. You can restart the kernel to clear all variables and start fresh.

* Magic Commands: Jupyter notebooks support special commands called "magic commands" that provide additional functionality. Magic commands start with a % symbol. For example, %matplotlib inline is a magic command that allows you to display Matplotlib plots directly in the notebook.

* Rich Output: Jupyter notebooks can display rich output, including images, videos, HTML, and interactive widgets. This makes them suitable for data analysis, visualization, and exploration.

* File Format: Notebooks are usually saved with the extension .ipynb, which stands for "IPython Notebook." These files can be shared and opened in various environments that support Jupyter.

* Jupyter Ecosystem: Jupyter is not limited to the notebook interface; it has an ecosystem of tools and extensions. JupyterLab is an advanced interactive development environment that provides a more flexible interface, while nbconvert allows you to convert notebooks to different formats, such as HTML or PDF.

* Popular Libraries: Jupyter notebooks are widely used in data science and scientific computing. Popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow are commonly used within Jupyter environments.

To use Jupyter notebooks, WE need to have Python or another supported language installed on your system. We can install Jupyter itself using the Python package manager (pip) by running the command pip install jupyter.

Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive and exploratory environment, making them popular in fields such as data science, machine learning, research, and education.
Here is the introduction about Jupyter notebooks. Where we get to know about all basics components of Jupyter Notebooks.

* To install Jupyter, we typically use a package manager like pip (for Python). We can install Jupyter by running:
# pip install jupyter
After installation, We can start Jupyter by typing jupyter notebook in our terminal or command prompt.

Certainly! Jupyter notebooks support various programming languages, but the most common one is Python. Below is the code of Jupyter notebook both code cells and markdown cells-



# This is a code cell
# You can write and execute Python code in these cells

# Cell 1: Python code
print("Hello, World!")

# Cell 2: Python code with variable assignment
a = 5
b = 10
result = a + b
result

# Cell 3: Python code with visualization using Matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Function')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.show()


Now, we will learn how to create a Notebook
  we know how to start a Notebook server, we should probably learn how to create an actual Notebook document
All we need to do is click on the New button (upper right), and it will open up a list of choices. On my machine, I happen to have Python 2 and Python 3 installed, so I can create a Notebook that uses either of these. For simplicity’s sake, let’s choose Python 3.
*Naming
we will notice that at the top of the page is the word Untitled. This is the title for the page and the name of our Notebook. Since that isn’t a very descriptive name, let’s change it!
Just move our mouse over the word Untitled and click on the text. we should now see an in-browser dialog titled Rename Notebook.

*Running Cells

A Notebook’s cell defaults to using code whenever we first create one, and that cell uses the kernel that we chose when we started your Notebook.
In this case, we started ours with Python 3 as our kernel, so that means we can write Python code in our code cells. Since our initial Notebook has only one empty cell in it, the Notebook can’t really do anything.
Thus, to verify that everything is working as it should, we can add some Python code to the cell and try running its contents.

Let’s try adding the following code to that cell:
print('Hello Jupyter!')
Running a cell means that we will execute the cell’s contents.
 To execute a cell, we can just select the cell and click the Run button that is in the row of buttons along the top. It’s towards the middle. If we prefer using our keyboard, we can just press Shift+Enter.
If we have multiple cells in our Notebook, and we run the cells in order, you can share your variables and imports across cells. This makes it easy to separate out your code into logical chunks without needing to reimport libraries or recreate variables or functions in every cell.

When you run a cell, you will notice that there are some square braces next to the word In to the left of the cell. The square braces will auto fill with a number that indicates the order that you ran the cells. For example, if you open a fresh Notebook and run the first cell at the top of the Notebook, the square braces will fill with the number 1.

*Starting Terminals and Other Things

Jupyter Notebook also allows you to start more than just Notebooks. You can also create a text file, a folder, or a Terminal in your browser. Go back to the home page that opened when you first started the Jupyter server at http://localhost:8888/tree. Go to the New button and choose one of the other options.

The Terminal is probably the most interesting of the bunch, as it is running your operating systems terminal in the browser. This allows you to run bash, Powershell, and so on in your browser and run any shell command that you might need to there.
Viewing What’s Running
Also on the home page of your Jupyter server (http://localhost:8888/tree) are two other tabs: Running and Clusters.

The Running tab will tell you which Notebooks and Terminals you are currently running. This is useful for when you want to shut down your server but you need to make sure that you have saved all your data. Fortunately, Notebooks auto-save pretty frequently, so you rarely lose data. But it’s good to be able to see what’s running when you need to.

The other nice thing about this tab is that you can go through your running applications and shut them down there.


To create a Jupyter Notebook using code, you can use the nbformat library to programmatically generate the notebook content. Here's a simple example of how you can create a Jupyter Notebook with a code cell using Python:

import nbformat

# Create a new Jupyter Notebook
notebook = nbformat.v4.new_notebook()

# Add a code cell to the notebook
code_cell = nbformat.v4.new_code_cell(
    source='print("Hello, Jupyter!")'
)

# Append the code cell to the notebook cells
notebook.cells.append(code_cell)

# Save the notebook to a file
file_path = 'hello_jupyter.ipynb'
with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
    nbformat.write(notebook, file)

print(f"Jupyter Notebook '{file_path}' created successfully.")
